# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning–based Email Spam Detection system** that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**.  
The model learns patterns from email content and accurately predicts whether an incoming email is spam.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies emails into **Spam** or **Ham**
- Uses **text preprocessing & feature extraction**
- Trained using **Machine Learning algorithms**
- Achieves high accuracy on test data
- Simple and efficient implementation in Python

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data handling
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models & evaluation
- **NLTK / CountVectorizer / TF-IDF** – Text processing
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset contains labeled email data (`Spam` / `Ham`)
- File used: `emails.xls`
- Includes email text and corresponding labels

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Text Vectorization
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Prediction on New Emails

---

## 📊 Model Performance
- Achieved **high accuracy and precision** on test data
- Effectively reduces false spam classification
